# =============================================================================
# eva_sb_syscredit_rtprime_skid_leanalu.py
# FINAL EVA ALLO VERSION — bubble/BSP model UNCHANGED, performance fixes applied.
#
# SYS-CREDIT variant of the scoreboard chip: the systolic plane gets the SAME
# credit protocol the router plane has (registered equivalent of golden EVA's
# rq/gt handshake: 2-slot buffer, stall-not-drop, LOSSLESS under any rate).
# M x N mesh of fused router+PE nodes, always-fire/bubble model; two overlaid
# 4-dir networks per node: systolic (data words) + router (packets).
#
# CHANGES vs eva_sb_syscredit_rtprime_leanalu.py (protocol/token sequences are
# BIT-IDENTICAL — golden traces and the cycle-exact RTL diff remain valid):
#
#  1. SKID-WINDOW drivers (drv_* and rdrv_*). The old drivers read din[sp]/
#     vd[sp] and let the read VALUE decide sp's next value — a loop-carried
#     memory dependence that left the loops unpipelined (IL=6 -> the measured
#     9 cyc/timestep chip period; the node was only ~2 of it). Now: a small
#     register window is PREFILLED before the loop and refilled AFTER each
#     send decision, so the decision at t only ever reads entries fetched at
#     t-1 or earlier — the BRAM read is off the recurrence and the loops
#     pipeline. Window head at time t holds slot index = #pops = the old sp,
#     so the per-t send/skip/bubble predicate is IDENTICAL (see proof sketch
#     at drv_w). Expected: chip period 9 -> ~2-3 (node-limited).
#
#  2. CREDIT PAYLOAD NARROWED: cr_*/scr_* streams carry CrTy = UInt(8)
#     (values are only 0..BUF_DEPTH=2). UInt(2) would be sufficient in the
#     source model, but previously triggered incorrect all-bubble emitted RTL;
#     8 bits still removes 24 boundary pins per credit stream while retaining
#     comfortable headroom for the mixed-width credit accumulations.
#
#  3. DATADRIVEN flag removed per its own TODO; the operand-validity grant
#     gate it guarded is kept UNCONDITIONALLY (it was always ==1).
#     txp_r removed (written, never read — dead state).
#
#  4. Comment corrections: the forwarding threshold's minimum read distance
#     is FP_LAT + 1, not FP_LAT (a producer at issue-distance d has
#     inflight = d-1, and rdy requires inflight >= FP_LAT). So FP_LAT=1
#     ALREADY guarantees every resq/cmpq read at distance >= 2 — the
#     distance-2 dependence directive below is sound with NO source change.
#
# COMPANION DIRECTIVES (REQUIRED — none of these have Allo primitives; they
# must be injected into the generated C++ / Tcl by the build flow):
#   * PIPELINE on EVERY per-t loop, INCLUDING all 8 driver and 8 collector
#     loops (the 8x8 NOSCHED->inject flow previously pipelined only the node
#     loop — that omission was the dominant cost). Target II=1; the skid
#     rewrite makes the driver loops schedulable.
#   * DEPENDENCE variable=resq  type=inter direction=RAW distance=2 dependent=true
#     DEPENDENCE variable=cmpq  type=inter direction=RAW distance=2 dependent=true
#     on the node t-loop (use post-lowering variable names). Sound because
#     d_min = FP_LAT+1 = 2 is enforced by the forwarding-scan rdy logic;
#     certified by trace diff + the fwd-at-distance-2 adversarial program.
#   * BIND_OP hadd/hmul latency=2 (II=1 x distance 2 covers latency 2).
#     NOTE both directions of silent bind divergence are on record: latency 2
#     requested -> 3-stage core instantiated (3.33 ns build) and latency 2
#     requested -> latency 1 instantiated (15 ns build). Check the Bind Op
#     table every build.
#   * gen_kernel.py PRIME_TOKENS/STREAM_DEPTH overrides (6/8) unchanged.
